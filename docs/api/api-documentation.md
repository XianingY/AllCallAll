# AllCallAll API Documentation

This is the maintained human-readable API map for the current codebase. Routes are registered from `backend/internal/server/routes.go` and `backend/internal/handlers/*`.

## Conventions

- Base URL: `http://localhost:8080` locally.
- API prefix: `/api/v1`.
- Protected endpoints use `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`.
- Collaboration endpoints use organization membership and often `X-Organization-ID`.
- Error responses keep the legacy `error` field and add `code` plus `request_id` on hardened paths.
- `/api/v1/chat/ws` is durable collaboration replay. `/api/v1/ws` and `/api/v1/signaling/*` are 1:1 signaling.
